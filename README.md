# CFX

This is a soft fork of the CFX sdk with some custom fields added to messages.

## Wave soldering

Additional wave sequence fields have been added along with some general metadata that can be gathered from Ersa PowerflowN2 wave soldering machines.

## Selective soldering

Added new namespace for selective soldering with respective fields. Overall structure is largely the same as for wave soldering.
